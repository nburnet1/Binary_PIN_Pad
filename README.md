# Binary PIN Pad
Over the past couple days I've had a lot of fun with the Raspberry Pi Pico. 

This was just a quick little project to get me familar with the Pico.

Below are the GPIO pins that I used:

- LED 2^3 (2)
- LED 2^2 (3)
- LED 2^1 (4)
- LED 2^0 (5)
- On Board LED (25)
- Zero Button (13)
- One Button (14)
- Buzzer (20)
- Clear Button (28)

I plan on releasing the circuit diagram at a later time!

Please let me know if you got this working or have any recommendations!
